# Hey there! 👋🏾

Welcome! I'm Terry, a game programmer currently obsessed with building Godot projects. Here's a little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating VR games and tools using the power of the Godot engine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about XR and networking in Godot to build social apps to connect with your online friends.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding the most optimal methods of learning new skills. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Godot or game development. I'm always interested in sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with fellow nerds.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to hit me on Github or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KirbyMumbo).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love composing game music for imaginary RPGs in the style of Koichi Suigyama.

Thanks for stopping by! Let's create some epic games and inspire the next generation of game developers together. 🎮✨
