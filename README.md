# Hey there! 👋🏾

Welcome! I'm Terry, a game programmer currently obsessed with building Godot projects. Here's a little bit about me:

- Currently learning all I can about XR and networking in Godot to build social apps to connect with your online friends.
- Looking for help with finding the most optimal methods of learning new skills. 
- Always interested in sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with fellow nerds.
- Composing game music for imaginary RPGs in the style of Koichi Suigyama.
