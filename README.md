# Hey there! 👋🏾

Welcome! I'm Terry, a budding game programmer specializing in Godot. Here's a little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating goofy 2D games and goofier tools using the power of the Godot engine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about XR and networking in Godot to build social apps to connect with your online friends.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding the most optimal methods of learning new skills. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Godot, game development, or programming in general. I'm always happy to share knowledge and exchange ideas with fellow nerds.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to hit me on Github or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KirbyMumbo).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of retro games and love incorporating nostalgic elements into my projects. Who doesn't love a good throwback?

Thanks for stopping by! Let's create some epic games and inspire the next generation of game developers together. 🎮✨
